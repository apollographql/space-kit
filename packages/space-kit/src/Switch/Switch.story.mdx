# Switch

**Switchs** use the same props schema as the underlying library from react-spectrum.

## Uncontrolled

Using the `defaultSelected` prop to indicate these components are uncontrolled; meaning their state is not controlled externally.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Uncontrolled Deselected">
    <Switch>Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Uncontrolled Selected">
    <Switch defaultSelected>Selected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Uncontrolled Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch isDisabled>Disabled Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Uncontrolled Disabled Selected">
    <Switch isDisabled defaultSelected>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Controlled

Pass `isSelected` and `onChange` props to indicate these components are controlled; meaning their state held and controlled externally.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Controlled Deselected">
    <Switch isSelected={false} onChange={noop}>
      Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Controlled Selected">
    <Switch isSelected onChange={noop}>
      Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Controlled Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch isDisabled isSelected={false} onChange={noop}>
      Disabled Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Controlled Disabled Selected">
    <Switch isDisabled isSelected onChange={noop}>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Dark

Elements can respond to the theme

<Canvas theme="dark">
  <Story name="Dark Themed Uncontrolled Deselected">
    <Switch theme="dark">Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Dark Themed Uncontrolled Selected">
    <Switch theme="dark" defaultSelected>
      Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Dark Themed Uncontrolled Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch theme="dark" isDisabled>
      Disabled Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Dark Themed Uncontrolled Disabled Selected">
    <Switch theme="dark" isDisabled defaultSelected>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Color

You can customize the color of the checkbox's selected state with the `color` prop

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Color Deselected">
    <Switch color={colors.green.base}>Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Color Selected">
    <Switch color={colors.green.base} defaultSelected>
      Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Color Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch color={colors.green.base} isDisabled>
      Disabled Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Color Disabled Selected">
    <Switch color={colors.green.base} isDisabled defaultSelected>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Focus

Switchs will show a border when focused from keyboard navigation and not from touches or clicks.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Focus Deselected">
    <Switch isFocusVisible>Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Focus Selected">
    <Switch isFocusVisible defaultSelected>
      Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Focus Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch isFocusVisible isDisabled>
      Disabled Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Focus Disabled Selected">
    <Switch isFocusVisible isDisabled defaultSelected>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Size

Switchs support several sizes

### Large

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Large, Deselected">
    <Switch size="large">Deslected</Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Large, Selected">
    <Switch size="large" defaultSelected>
      Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Large, Disabled Deselected">
    <Switch size="large" isDisabled>
      Disabled Deslected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Large, Disabled Selected">
    <Switch size="large" isDisabled defaultSelected>
      Disabled Selected
    </Switch>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
