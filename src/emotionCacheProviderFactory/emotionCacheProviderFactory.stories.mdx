# Emotion

All components are styled with [emotion](https://emotion.sh).

## Control Your Emotion

Emotion appends `<style>` tags to your `<head>` element at runtime. This may cause emotions's styles to be included _after_ your project's styles, preventing you from using your own classes to override emotion's.

Ideally we'd be able to use Emotion's `<CacheProvider>` to control where Space Kit's styles would be injected, but an emotion bug ([emotion-js/emotion#1386](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/1386)) causes `CacheProvider`s to not be recognized for bundled components.

To get around this issue, we export the `emotionCacheProviderFactory` factory that you can use to create a cache provider targetting a specific DOM node for emotion's Space Kit styles.

Example:

```jsx
import { emotionCacheProviderFactory } from "@apollo/space-kit/emotionCacheProviderFactory";

// Create the provider
const CacheProvider = emotionCacheProviderFactor(
  // Element we want to target
  document.queryElement("#spaceKitEmotionStyleContainer")
);

// Wrap application with `CacheProvider`
const App = (
  <CacheProvider>
    <AppCode />
  </CacheProvider>
);
```

This expects the following to exist somewhere in the DOM:

```html
<style id="spaceKitEmotionStyleContainer"></style>
```

All styles will be placed inside of that component.
