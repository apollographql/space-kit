# Icons

All our icons are displayed in the [icon gallery](/?path=/docs/components-icons--icon-add).

Note that there are no styles or classes applied to the SVGs by default; you'll have to add a `width` and `height` to see the icons; and apply a text color to color them.

All our icons are SVG files stored in [`./src/icons/svgs/`](https://github.com/apollographql/space-kit/tree/main/src/icons/svgs). There are scripts set up to convert these SVGs into React components, and then to transpile those files for consumption. These conversions and transpilations are `.gitignore`'ed, so they are not maintained in source control.

### Adding new icons

To add a new icon, add the SVG for your icon to the appropriately named folder for the icon category in [`./src/icons/svgs/`](https://github.com/apollographql/space-kit/tree/main/src/icons/svgs), and open a PR.

Fill and stroke colors with values `#000` or `#000000` will be replace by `currentColor` to allow the consumer to change the colors; all other colors will be maintained and will not be configurable.

All React components will be automatically generated and the TypeScript will be transpiled automatically after your branch is merged to `main`.

The following scripts are available:

- `icons:clean`: Clean all the React components and TypeScript generated files from the `icons/` directory. This will not touch the raw svg files in `icons/src`.
- `icons:generate`: Generate TypeScript files for each icon. These will be immediately available in Storybook.
- `icons`: Run `icons:clean` and `icons:generate` in series
- `build:typescript`: Transpile TypeScript files to be consumed externally.
- `watch`: Watch TypeScript files and automatically update.
  This is useful when you've `npm link`'ed this repository and are developing against another project.

### Streamline vs custom icons

Most of our icons are _not_ open source and are only licensed for use in this project. They are licensed from the commercial [Streamline library](https://app.streamlineicons.com/streamline-regular). See [license](https://github.com/apollographql/space-kit/blob/main/src/icons/LICENSE.md) for more details.

Many of our newer icons have been custom created by the design team. Over time we may move more toward a fully custom set, so when possible please consult the design team about making a new custom icon vs adding another from the Streamline set.

You can tell which icons are from Streamline and which are our own by looking at the [SpaceKit-Icons frame](https://www.figma.com/file/0vwEKqkB3mxfsy4V6VwCUO/Space-Kit?node-id=0%3A4426) in Figma. Streamline icons have a `-sl` suffix on the icon name.

### Illustrations

Similar to icons, Space Kit illustrations are stored and generated from [`src/illustrations/svgs`](./src/illustrations/svgs). To build the stories for newly added illustrations, run `npm run illustrations:generate`.

### Pictograms

Similar to icons & illustrations, Space Kit pictograms are stored and generated from [`src/pictograms/svgs`](./src/pictograms/svgs). To build the stories for newly added pictograms, run `npm run pictograms:generate`.
