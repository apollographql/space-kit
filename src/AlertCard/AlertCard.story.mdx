<Description

  markdown="**AlertCards** provide a way to display short, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task."
/>

## Info Alert

Informational alerts present general info about something you are doing or working with. It is neutral and conveys no implications of success or failure.

<Preview>
  <Story name="info light">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      color={colors.blue.base}
      icon={<IconInfoSolid />}
      heading="Informational alert"
    >
      This is a general informational message telling you about something. Learn
      more
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
  <Story name="info dark">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      color={colors.blue.base}
      icon={<IconInfoSolid css={{ "& .inner": { fill: colors.white } }} />}
      theme="dark"
      heading="Informational alert"
    >
      This is a general informational message telling you about something. Learn

### Extended

The extended card variant is for rare use cases where an alert is the most appropriate format for explaining longer instructions.

<Preview>
  <Story name="info light extended">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      color={colors.blue.base}
      icon={<IconInfoSolid />}
      heading="Informational alert"
      extended={true}
    >
      In some cases it may be appropriate for the toast card to give a longer
      message, or a set of instructions helping users navigate complicated
      situations in the workflow.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is typically preferrable to link out to a docs article in situations like
      this, but there are cases where you may also need to include a lengthy amount
      of content with the card because it will be immediately useful to the user
      in their workflow.
      <br />
      <br />
      If a toast card’s content requires more than one paragraph, use the
      expanded content toast variant.
    </AlertCard>
