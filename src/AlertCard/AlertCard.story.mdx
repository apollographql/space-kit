# AlertCard

**AlertCards** provide a way to display short, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.

## Info Alert

Informational alerts present general info about something you are doing or working with. It is neutral and conveys no implications of success or failure.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="info light">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="info"
      heading="Informational alert"
    >
      This is a general informational message telling you about something. Learn
      more
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
  <Story name="info dark">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="info"
      theme="dark"
      heading="Informational alert"
    >
      This is a general informational message telling you about something. Learn
      more
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Extended

The extended card variant is for rare use cases where an alert is the most appropriate format for explaining longer instructions.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="info light extended">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="info"
      heading="Informational alert"
      extended={true}
    >
      In some cases it may be appropriate for the toast card to give a longer
      message, or a set of instructions helping users navigate complicated
      situations in the workflow.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is typically preferrable to link out to a docs article in situations like
      this, but there are cases where you may also need to include a lengthy amount
      of content with the card because it will be immediately useful to the user
      in their workflow.
      <br />
      <br />
      If a toast card’s content requires more than one paragraph, use the
      expanded content toast variant.
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
  <Story name="info dark extended">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="info"
      theme="dark"
      heading="Informational alert"
      extended={true}
    >

## Warning Alert

Warning alerts present information about the action that is about to be taken that alerts the user to consequences of the action and asks for confirmation that the action still be taken in light of the consequences.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="warning light">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="warn"
      heading="Warning alert"
      actions={<Button size="small">Confirm</Button>}
    >
      exceededSubLimitAt is a deprecated field. You can use it but it may not
      work as expected.
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
  <Story name="warning dark">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="warn"
      heading="Warning alert"
      theme="dark"
      actions={
        <Button theme="dark" size="small">
          Confirm
        </Button>
      }
    >
      exceededSubLimitAt is a deprecated field. You can use it but it may not
      work as expected.
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Error Alert

Error alerts let the user know that something has gone wrong or is blocked in the given workflow they are trying to complete. When possible, error alerts should contain helpful information about what has happened to help unblock the user (such as steps to resolve or a link to a docs article).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="error light">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="error"
      heading="Error alert"
      style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
    >
      Something is broken. You cannot perform this action at this time.
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
  <Story name="error dark">
    <AlertCard
      onClose={() => undefined}
      type="error"
      heading="Error alert"
      theme="dark"
      style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
    >
      Something is broken. You cannot perform this action at this time.
    </AlertCard>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
