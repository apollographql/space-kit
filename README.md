## Installation

```shell
npm install @apollo/space-kit
```

## Usage

Import things into your JS app from the `@apollo/space-kit` package. All available exports are documented [here](#exports).

```js
import "@apollo/space-kit/reset.css"; // import this at app root
import { colors } from "@apollo/space-kit";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        backgroundColor: colors.indigo.dark,
        color: "white",
        border: `1px solid ${colors.grey.light}`,
      }}
    >
      ...
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Stylesheet reset

A "base" stylesheet with a few sensible rules. It uses [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to smooth out any inconsistencies between the ways that different browsers render elements. It also applies `box-sizing: border-box;` to everything, for [a better element sizing experience](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/). Lastly, the stylesheet imports and sets our two main font families: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro), and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro).

You'll probably want to include this file once in your app, ideally at the top-most level. For instance, in a Gatsby site that would be your [`layout.js` component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/layout-components/).

**JS + webpack or similar**

```js
import "@apollo/space-kit/reset.css";
```

**LESS**

```less
@import (inline) "../node_modules/@apollo/space-kit/reset.css
```

### Colors

A JavaScript object that maps color names to palettes of hex codes to apply on-brand color to elements on a page. The available colors include:

- `pink`
- `teal`
- `indigo`
- `black`
- `grey`
- `silver`
- `red`
- `green`
- `blue`
- `orange`
- `yellow`
- `purple`

When you access a color by name (i.e. `colors.indigo`), you'll find a palette of hex codes keyed by a "lightness" variant. These include:

- `base`
- `dark`
- `darker`
- `darkest` (not on `black`, `grey`, or `silver`)
- `light`
- `lighter`
- `lightest` (not on `black`, `grey`, or `silver`)

**CSS-in-JS**

```jsx
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
import { colors } from "@apollo/space-kit";

const StyledButton = styled.button({
  backgroundColor: colors.indigo.dark,
  color: "white",
  border: `1px solid ${colors.grey.light}`,
});

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <StyledButton>Save</StyledButton>
      <StyledButton
        style={{
          backgroundColor: colors.red.base,
        }}
      >
        Delete
      </StyledButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Icons

All our icons are displayed in a gallery in [Storybook](https://space-kit.netlify.com/?path=/story/space-kit--icons).

Note that there are no styles or classes applied to the SVGs by default; you'll have to add a `width` and `height` to see the icons; and apply a text color to color them.

All our icons are SVG files stored in [`./icons/src/svgs`](./icons/src/svgs). There are scripts set up to convert these SVGs into React components, and then to transpile those files for consumption. These conversions and transpilations are `.gitignore`'ed, so they are not maintained in source control.

These icons are _not_ open source and are only licensed for use in this project. See [license](./icons/LICENSE.md) for more details.

Please see [#developing-space-kit-icons](#icons-1) for instructions on adding new icons.

### Typography

Zeplin: https://zpl.io/V4ep7Jy

We decided to export our typography style system as plain old JavaScript to allow consumers to chose how to implement the configurations. The names relate to each other and do not imply intent. For example, we did not use the names "title" or "caption" because the style system only gives the options; it's up to each consumer to chose a style guide.

To consume these types with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), one would create a plugin to add a [utility](https://v0.tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-utilities) to add these classnames.

This example will use the original names prefixed with `space-kit-`:

```js
const typographyConfig = require("@apollo/space-kit/typography");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    function spaceKitTypography({ addUtilities }) {
      addUtilities(
        Object.entries(typographyConfig.base).reduce(
          (accumulator, [name, properties]) => ({
            ...accumulator,
            [`.space-kit-${name}`]: properties,
          }),
          {}
        )
      );
    },
  ],
};
```

You could also use the style system to add intent:

```js
const typographyConfig = require("@apollo/space-kit/typography");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    function spaceKitTypography({ addUtilities }) {
      addUtilities({
        ".space-kit-title": typographyConfig.base.xxxlarge,
        ".caption": typographyConfig.base.xsmall,
      });
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Example

```js
import React from "react";
import { IconServices } from "@apollo/space-kit/icons/IconServices";

export const IconServiceItem: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="w-5 h-5">
    <IconServices className="w-full h-full text-teal" />
  </div>
);
```

### Buttons

Zeplin: https://zpl.io/amdN6Pr

This is our style system for buttons. This is intended to be used to create your project's style guide (as opposed to using this component directly in your project).

#### Gotchas

- Apply colors with emotion or classNames.
- If you want to override the disabled styles, you need to apply a class for `:disabled` _and_ `:disabled:hover` to make sure the disabled button doesn't have it's styles overriden by the `:hover` styles.

#### Tailwind Example

```js
import React from "react";
import classnames from "classnames";
import { Button } from "@apollo/space-kit/Button";

export const PrimaryButton: React.FC<ComponentProps<typeof Button>> = ({
  children,
  className,
  ...otherProps
}) => (
  <Button
    {...otherProps}
    className={classnames(
      className,
      "bg-indigo hover:bg-indigo-dark text-white"
    )}
  >
    {children}
  </Button>
);
```

#### Emotion Example

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@apollo/space-kit/Button";
import { colors } from "@apollo/space-kit/colors";
import { jsx } from "@emotion/core";

export const PrimaryButton: React.FC<ComponentProps<typeof Button>> = ({
  children,
  ...otherProps
}) => (
  <Button
    {...otherProps}
    css={{
      backgroundColor: colors.indigo.dark,
      color: "white",
      hover: { backgroundColor: colors.indigo.darker },
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </Button>
);
```

#### FAQ

##### My icons aren't showing up in the UI

Make sure that the icon component has a width and height applied to it. That can mean applying classes or styles directly to the Icon component, or setting the component to have `height: 100%` and `width: 100%` and then applying a size to the containing element.

##### Why can't I import from `IconServices` from `@apollo/space-kit/icons`?

My goal was to minimze the bundle size increase caused by using these icons. If I had named exports from `space-kit/icons`, then the user would have to make sure they are tree-shaking to only import the icons they are actually using. `engine-frontend` is _not_ yet tree-shaking, so we decided to not make the imports an option.

##### Why does each icon have a named export instead of a default export?

The engine-frontend team and Apollo OSS teams have decided to not use default exports; this continues that trend.

## Developing Space Kit

To develop, run `npm run watch` and everything should build automatically! Use `npm link` to develop against this package.

When developing a new feature of space-kit, please make sure that the `watch` script will automatically perform all setps necessary to build for development. For example, there is a `watch:typescript` script and a `watch:npmwatch` script that will watch all TypeScript files and watch all the svg icons for changes.

### Icons

Our icons are all stored in [`icons/src/svgs`](./icons/src/svgs) in folders named for the icon category. To add new icons, add svg files to one of these category folders and open a pull request. Fill and stroke colors with values `#000` or `#000000` will be replace by `currentColor` to allow the consumer to change the colors; all other colors will be maintained and will not be configurable.

All React components will be automatically generated and the TypeScript will be transpiled automatically after merging to `master`.

The following scripts are available:

- `icons:clean`: Clean all the React components and TypeScript generated files from the `icons/` directory. This will not touch the raw svg files in `icons/src`.
- `icons:generate`: Generate TypeScript files for each icon. These will be immediately available in Storybook.
- `icons`: Run `icons:clean` and `icons:genreate` in series
- `build:typescript`: Transpile TypeScript files to be consumed externally.
- `watch`: Watch TypeScript files and automatically update.

  This is useful when you've `npm link`'ed this repository and are developing against another project.

### TypeScript

To watch all TypeScript projects for development, run the `npm run watch` script.

### Storybook

Many elements of Space Kit are showcased in Storybook, which can be used for local development by running:

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```

All pull requests will automatically generate deploy previews and the `master` branch is automatically deployed to https://space-kit.netlify.com.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d5469491-a3d2-4ee1-b31d-d7f87ae806f8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/space-kit/deploys)

## Releasing

To release a new version, bump the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` by using [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) and then [`npm publish`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) as the `apollo-bot` user. It's always a very good idea to perform an `npm publish` with the `--dry-run` flag to make sure you're only publishing the files you expected to.

All compilation and build steps are expected to be performed automatically when running the `npm prepare` script. If you add new functionality that needs a build step, that should be executed somewhere in `npm build`; this ensures that build steps remain consistent and will allow us to eventually automatically deploy new versions to npm from CI.

### Beta Releases

While local development should be done with [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link),sometimes we need to release pre-release versions. This will require you use `npm version` to bump the package (prepatch, preminor, or premajor would be a smart move). Then you can use `npm publish --tag=next` (or whatever tag you want to use).
